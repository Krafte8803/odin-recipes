<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<p></p>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>one pack of quality pasta (preferably spaghetti)</li>
        <li>a considerable amount of olive oil (extra vergine and not the cheap stuff!)</li>
        <li>sea salt (also not only a little bit)</li>
        <li>pepper (and please freshly grinded)</li>
        <li>basil (The green, living plant. No dried stuff!) </li>
        <li>garlic (fresh for sure)</li>
        <li>some parmigiano reggiano</li>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil some water, just enough, and season to taste with salt.</li>
        <li>Add your spaghetti to the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Preheat a pan and place a generous amount of oil in it. As soon as you can smell the olive oil, reduce the heat to a minimum.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, cut the chilly in to fine slices. Having a sharp knive helps alot.</li>
        <li>Do the same to the garlic and place both in the now hot olive oil.</li>
        <li>Now your pasta should be al dente and you place it in the oil, too.</li>
        <li>Season with freshly grinded pepper to taste and give it a good stir. Pro Tip: A splash of starchy pasta water gives it a twist and some creamy texture)</li>
        <li>Now quickly chop the basil, place the pasta on a plate and garnish with basil and parmigiano.</li>
    </ol>
